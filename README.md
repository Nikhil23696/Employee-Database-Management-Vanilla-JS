This is a Employee Database management project built using pure Javascript just to master my command on JS

I have learned following things from this project
1) fetching data from data.json
2) rendering fetched data
3) Creating modal using JS
4) Form handeling - submitting form, appending new data in data.json
5) alternative of outlet in react
